# ECG
12 lead ECG signal process program 
#The matlab code- 
#the purpose of the matlab code is to extract the ECG image to signal, and transform it into db8 CWT transform.

1.Open the "Signal2CWT.m"
2.Build two data files called "data2" and "data2_output"
3.enter the path for input file and output file.

*for the cliping data problem have to reset the coordinate for the CWT image.


ï¼ƒpython code-
#the purpose of the two python code are to training and scoring the db8 CWT image.

1. Open the "Training code.ipynb" for training 12-lead data.
2. Open the "Testing_code_ROC_curve.ipynb" for scoring the 12-lead image.
